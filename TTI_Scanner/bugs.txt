1. Resize sucks....
4. when you show the message about black list it needs to be in focus at the front, now its stays in the task bar blinking
5. delete option - from to by date and individual
7. Can you add a note area like the black list but just text?
8. Previous check-ins - the list is "weird"

FIXED
2. It won't pick the sex from the XML
3. Auto-refresh needs to be the default when opening
6. When moving the xml to the archive do not change name, if the db is damaged I cannot recreate
